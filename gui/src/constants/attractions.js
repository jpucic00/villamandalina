    title: "St Nicholas' Fortress",
    text: "St Nicholas' Fortress at the entrance to the St Anthony's Channel in Šibenik represents a unique Renaissance building of Venetian fortification architecture and an exceptional monument of the world’s architectural heritage. It was constructed on the islet of Ljuljevac, where once was the Benedictine monastery of St Nicholas, after which the fortress was named. The construction of the fortress, based on Gian Girolamo San Micheli’s design, commenced in 1540 after the fall of Skradin under the Ottoman rule, when the Venetians were forced to strengthen the defence of Šibenik port, which was the most important port on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea.",

    title: "St Anthony’s Channel",
    text: "The St Anthony’s Channel is part of a wider location called Channel – Port, which represents a significant landscape protected in 1974. It is more than 2000 metres long and 140 – 220 metres wide. It is a gateway to the open sea and entrance to Šibenik. At the same time, the channel represents a symbolical end of the Krka River, since it is where the river flows into the Adriatic Sea. It can be seen from all parts of Šibenik and despite being in close proximity to the city and easily accessible, it used to be isolated and unknown due to historical circumstances. Apart from the obvious natural attractions and a magnificent panoramic view of Šibenik, the Šibenik archipelago and St Nicholas’ Fortress, the channel treasures numerous cultural and natural values.",
